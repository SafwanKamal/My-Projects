# My-Projects


You will find the executables of the projects at the following drive link:

Please be warned that Windows will flag these .exe files to be "dangerous" or block them from running. You have to give permission from the anti-virus software you are using to run these files. 


You can also download the Godot game engine and run the programs inside the engine by downloading the project files here at github. 

For most of the projects, Godot version 3.5 can be used to open them. Godot version 4 has introduced significant changes that affect backward compatibility.
